# OpenShift4-tools

[Robert Krawitz's](mailto:rlk@redhat.com) tools for installing
etc. OpenShift 4 clusters.

## Cluster utilities

- *oinst*: OpenShift 4.x installer wrapper, currently for AWS and libvirt.

  You may want to install kubechart
  (github.com/sjenning/kubechart/kubechart) and oschart
  (github.com/sjenning/oschart/oschart) to monitor the cluster as it
  boots and runs.

  I welcome PRs to extend this to other platforms.

- *waitfor-pod*: wait for a specified pod to make its appearance (used
  as a helper by *oinst*).

- *bastion-ssh* and *bastion-scp* -- use an ssh bastion to access
   cluster nodes.

- *install-custom-kubelet* -- install a custom kubelet into a cluster.

- *set-worker-parameters* -- set various kubelet parameters and wait
  for the operation to complete

- *clean-cluster*: clean up a libvirt cluster if
  `openshift-install destroy cluster` doesn't work.

- *get-first-master*: find the external IP address first master node of
  a cluster.

- *get-masters*: get the external IP addresses of all of the master
  nodes of a cluster.

- *get-nodes*: get the external (if available) or internal IP address
  of each node in a cluster.

## Testing tools

- *clusterbuster* -- generate pods, namespaces, and secrets to stress
  test a cluster.

- *monitor-pod-status* -- periodically print summary information about
  objects generated by *clusterbuster*.

## General information tools

- *openshift-release-info* -- get various information about one or
  more releases.

- *get-container-status*: retrieve the status of each running
  container on the cluster.

- *get-images*: retrieve the image and version of each image used by
  the cluster.
